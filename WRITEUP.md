### Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app.

*For **both** a VM or App Service solution for the CMS app:*
I would chose a Azure Web App here as it is a lower cost setup then VMs. In terms of workload you can easily spool up an azure web app rather then a vm which would require more knowledge of the underlying subsystems to get it working. They are also nice as they are easily scalable and flexible unlike a vm which is more rigid in its design.
### Assess app changes that would change your decision.

One thing that would really change my decision is if I needed more control of the os and environment. While Azure Web apps provide easy access if you need to have full control of the environment a vm is the way to go.
